# Access-Authorization-Library
Designed and implemented an authentication and access control (authorization) library. The access control system that I designed supports: Users, Domains, Types & Access Permissions.


Users: A collection of usernames and passwords used to authenticate users and tracking members of domanins.

Domains: A collection of zero or more users.

Types: A named collection of zero or more objects. Objects are any string that have meaning to the application.

Access Permissions: Set access right that define operations that domains can perofrm on types (view, delete).
